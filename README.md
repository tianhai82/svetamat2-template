# svetamat2-template

This is a fork of Svelte's project template to enable usage of [**Svetamat** - A set of Material UI widgets built on Tailwindcss](https://github.com/tianhai82/svetamat).

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit tianhai82/svetamat2-template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
yarn
```

...then start [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/):

```bash
yarn start
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
